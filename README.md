# Robot Game

A two-dimensional pygame program as the second last exercise of a Python course. The python course is at https://programming-23.mooc.fi/ and all lessons are free. I very much recommend this for any beginners trying to learn Python.

Time needed from scratch: 2 days (> 4 hours)

## Installation

Download robot-game-main.zip and unpack to your desired file location. After that, run robot.py on any console window. 

## How to play

The objective of this game is to move the robot and catching the falling asteroids. If an asteroid falls through, the game will reset all stats.

### Controls
- Your robot is controlled with the left and right arrow keys.
### Points
- The number of asteroids you catch is the amount of points you have (displayed on the upper-right corner).
